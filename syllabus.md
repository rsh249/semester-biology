### Required Texts

There is no required text book for this class.


### Course Description

Computers are increasingly essential to the study of all aspects of
biology. Data management skills are needed for entering data without errors,
storing it in a usable way, and extracting key aspects of the data for
analysis. Basic programming is required for everything from accessing and
managing data, to statistical analysis, to modeling. This course will provide an
introduction to data management, manipulation, and analysis, with an emphasis on
biological problems. Class will typically consist of short introductions or
question & answer sessions, followed by hands on computing exercises. The course
will be taught using R and SQLite, but the concepts learned will easily apply to
all programming languages and database management systems. No background in
programming or databases is required.


### Prerequisite Knowledge and Skills

Knowledge of basic biology.


### Purpose of Course

In this course you will learn all of the fundamental aspects of computer
programming that are necessary for conducting biological research. By the end of
the course you will be able to use these tools to import data into R, perform
analysis on that data, and export the results to graphs, text files, and
databases. By learning how to get the computer to do your work for you, you will
be able to do more science faster.


### Course Goals and Objectives

Students completing this course will be able to:

* Create well structured databases
* Extract information from databases
* Write simple computer programs in R
* Automate data analysis
* Apply these tools to address biological questions
* Apply general data management and analysis concepts to other programming
  languages and database management systems


### How this course relates to the Student Learning Outcomes in Wildlife Ecology and Conservation

This course contributes to the 'Quantitative Skills' and 'Conducting and
Analyzing Independent/Original Research' Student Learning Outcomes specified in
the
[Ph.D. and MS in Wildlife Ecology and Conservation Academic Assessment Plans](http://assessment.aa.ufl.edu/Data/Sites/22/media/2013-14gaap/cals/2013-14-cals-wildlife-ecol-and-consvn-phd-aap.pdf),
by providing students the skills and knowledge they need to manage and analyze
the data used in research.


### Teaching Philosophy

This class is taught using a flipped, learner-centered, approach, because
learning to program and work with data requires actively working on
computers. Flipped classes work well for all kinds of content, but I think they
work particularly well for computer oriented classes. If you're interested in
knowing more take a look at this great
[info-graphic](https://www.knewton.com/flipped-classroom-2/).


### Instructional Methods

As a flipped classroom, students are provided with either reading or video
material that they are expected to view/read prior to class. Classes will
involve brief refreshers on new concepts followed by working on exercises in
class that cover that concept. While students are working on exercises the
instructor will actively engage with students to help them understand material
they find confusing, explain misunderstandings and help identify mistakes that
are preventing students from completing the exercises, and discuss novel
applications and alternative approaches to the data analysis challenges students
are attempting to solve. For more challenging topics class may start with 20-30
minute demonstrations on the concepts followed by time to work on exercises.


## Course Policies


### Attendance Policy

Attendance will not be taken or factor into the grades for this class. However,
experience suggests that students who regularly miss class struggle to learn the
material.


### Quiz/Exam Policy

There are no quizzes or exams in this course.


### Make-up policy

Life happens and therefore there is an automatic grace period of 48 hours for
the submission of late assignments with no need to request an extension.
However, it is highly recommended that you submit assignments on time when
possible because assignments build on one another and it can be hard to catch up
if you fall behind. Reasonable requests for longer extensions will also be granted.


### Assignment policy

Assignments are due Monday night by 11:59 pm Eastern Time. Assignments should be
submitted via Canvas. This allows you to be finished with one week's material
before starting the next week's material.


### Course Technology

Students are required to provide their own laptops and to install free and open
source software on those laptops (see [Setup]({{ site.baseurl }}/computer-setup)
for installation instructions). Support will be provided by the instructor in
the installation of required software. If you don't have access to a laptop
please contact the instructor and they will do their best to provide you with
one.


## UF Policies


### University Policy on Accommodating Students with Disabilities

Students requesting accommodation for disabilities must first register with the
Dean of Students Office (http://www.dso.ufl.edu/drc/). The Dean of Students
Office will provide documentation to the student who must then provide this
documentation to the instructor when requesting accommodation. You must submit
this documentation prior to submitting assignments or taking the quizzes or
exams. Accommodations are not retroactive, therefore, students should contact
the office as soon as possible in the term for which they are seeking
accommodations.


### University Policy on Academic Misconduct

Academic honesty and integrity are fundamental values of the University
community. Students should be sure that they understand the UF Student Honor
Code at http://www.dso.ufl.edu/students.php.


### Netiquette and Communication Courtesy

All members of the class are expected to follow rules of common
courtesy in all email messages, threaded discussions and chats.


## Getting Help

For issues with technical difficulties for E-learning in Canvas, please contact the UF Help Desk at:

* Learning-support@ufl.edu
* (352) 392-HELP - select option 2
* https://lss.at.ufl.edu/help.shtml

Any requests for make-ups due to technical issues MUST be accompanied by the
ticket number received from LSS when the problem was reported to them. The
ticket number will document the time and date of the problem. You MUST e-mail
your instructor within 24 hours of the technical difficulty if you wish to
request a make-up.

Other resources are available at http://www.distance.ufl.edu/getting-help for:

* Counseling and Wellness resources
* Disability resources
* Resources for handling student concerns and complaints
* Library Help Desk support

Should you have any complaints with your experience in this course please visit
http://www.distance.ufl.edu/student-complaints to submit a complaint.

**Most importantly, if you are struggling for any reason please come talk to me
and I will do my best to help.**


## Grading Policies

Grading for this course is based on 13 equally weighted assignments. One problem
from each assignment (selected at the instructors discretion after the
assignments have been submitted) will receive a thorough code review and a
detailed grade. Other problems will be graded as follows:

* Produces the correct answer using the requested approach: 100%
* Generally uses the right approach, but a minor mistake results in an incorrect
    answer: 90%
* Attempts to solve the problem and makes some progress using the core concept:
    50%
* Answer demonstrates a lack of understanding of the core concept: 0%

Independent projects may focus on databases, programming, or a combination or
the two.
